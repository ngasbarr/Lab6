This is a lab project for 67-272: Application Design and Development.  The primary objectives of this lab are (1) to teach students how to do basic unit testing using factories rather than fixtures, and (2) to handle date validations in Rails, since there are no built-in validators for dates in the framework.  

This project assumes that this is for one publisher (in this case the infamous Acme Publishing, which is the favorite publisher for Wiley Coyote and producer of great tech books).  In this case, Acme not only wants to track books and authors, but also wants to track books through the various stages of the publishing process: from the initial proposals to signing a contract with author(s) to finally publishing the book.

To set this up, clone this repository, run the 'bundle install' command to ensure you have all the needed gems and then create the database with 'rake db:migrate'.  If you want to populate the system with fictitious, but somewhat realistic data, you can run the 'rake db:populate' command to get 50 authors and 54 books (from 13 categories) in various stages of the publishing process. 

Instructions for how to complete the lab and fill in the missing components can be found in the lab document itself.
